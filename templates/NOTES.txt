Logz.io fluentd is being deployed to your cluster.
You should see logs flowing once the fluentd image
is downloaded and started.

You can check the deployment status by running:

kubectl get daemonset {{ .Chart.Name }} --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }}

Give your logs some time to get from your system to ours,
and then open [Kibana](https://app.logz.io/#/dashboard/kibana).

If you still don't see your logs,
see [log shipping troubleshooting](https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/log-shipping/log-shipping-troubleshooting.html).
